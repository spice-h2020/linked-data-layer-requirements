# Technical Requirements


This repository is meant for collecting the technical requirements for the SPICE's Linked Data Hub.

All manner of contributions are important and anyone may propose new requirements.

## Format

Requirements can be specified in natural language as [User Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story).
User stories are short descriptions of a system requirement written from the perspective of an end user of the system.
They generally have the following form:

```
[User Story Identifier] As a type-of-user, I want to some-goal (so that some-reason, optionally). 
```

For example, 

```
[InappropriateContent] As a custodian/creator, I want to identify and filter user-generated content that can be inappropriate.
```

## Guidelines for contributors

You can contribute with the collection of requirments by submitting new stories or by discussing the existing ones.
Stories are collected as issues of this repository.

Before submitting a new story please check if there already exist stories that already cover the requirement.
If not, you can submit such a story by opening a new issue and by putting the user story itself as the title.

Feel free to open new issues if you are not sure if the requirement is already covered by existing stories or you need some help for formulating the story.
